This Project is a part of WiDS-I Program

Developers: Andrew Barry, Sydney Green, Hillary Yarosh

Coach: Sian Lewis

### PROBLEM STATEMENT: Predict the energy consumption of buildings based on historical data. 

### DATA: 

Historical Consumption: A selected time series of consumption data for over 200 buildings

Building Metadata: Information Including Site number of building, surface area of building, temperatures of the building, and data on if the building is open or closed.

Public Holidays Data: Includes name and dates of holidays for each site ID.

Historical Weather Data: Information on the temperature of the weather station and the timestamp of measurement. 


### Methodology:

1. Create visualizations of data
2. Feature selection & engineering (Correlation Matrix)
3. Build model
4. Feature Importance
5. Evaluate Models
6. Build applications for users
